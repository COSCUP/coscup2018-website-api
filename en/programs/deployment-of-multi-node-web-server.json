What is Ansible? Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine which can remove drudgery from your work life, and will also dramatically improve the scalability, consistency, and reliability of your IT environment. \nWe use ansible to deploy web servers, database servers with galera clusters, and session storage servers with master-slave mode. With the use of this tool can reduce the time required in deployment servers, and unidentical server in a group can be avoided \n\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-deployment-of-multi-node-web-server)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Didiet Agus Pambudiono":{"speaker":"Didiet Agus Pambudiono","name":"Didiet Agus Pambudiono","intro":"openSUSE user, member of openSUSE Indonesia, and Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE.Asia Summit is one of the great events for openSUSE community (i.e., both contributors, and users) in Asia.
