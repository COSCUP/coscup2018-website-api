We can use the mechanism to store a random number in boot services variable as a root key. The root key can be sused to encrypt and authenticate other keys in key retention service in Linux kernel. It can be a new key type.\n\nThis talk introduces the EFI key: \n- EFI key: \n- A new master key type to key retention service. \n- It can be a new option beyond trusted key(TPM) and user key. \n- ERK (EFI Root Key) \n- EFI stub generates a random key and stores in EFI boot services variable. \n- The ERK is secure when secure boot enabled. \n- User must aware and enable secure boot by themself if they want. \n- ERK can be a secret to encrypt a random number for generate a EFI key \n- The EFI key can be used by hibernation encryption/authentication. \n- The EFI key can be a master key to generate a encrypted key for EVM. \n- Rescue mechanism for ERK. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-efi-key)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Joey Lee":{"speaker":"Joey Lee","name":"Joey Lee","intro":"Joey Lee, SUSE Labs Engineer in Taipei office.

Those who usually communicate online can get together from all over the world, talk face to face, and have fun. Members of the community will share their most recent knowledge, experiences, and learn FLOSS technologies surrounding openSUSE.\n\nThis event at Taipei is the fifth in openSUSE.Asia Summit. Following the first Asia Summit in Beijing 2014. The past Asia Summits have had participants from China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and etc.","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
