In this talk I will give a brief introduction of HiDPI and share the status of HiDPI support on openSUSE Leap15 and summarize how to tweak the scaling factors for YaST Installer, Grub2(on both Legacy and UEFI mode), GDM, GNOME Session, SDDM, KDE Plasma, other apps (on both X and Wayland), some known issues and the support of fractional scaling from a Desktop user's perspective.\n\nHopefully this talk will help some openSUSE users to get their life with a HiDPI screen more pleasant.\n\nAbout the Speaker: \nMy name is Chingkai Chu, I am a software engineer from Beijing SLE Desktop Dev&QA Team. This talk is based on a HiDPI testing for SLED15 and openSUSE Leap15 in my team.
