Covering various areas like providing support through forums, irc and email through to getting involved with development in areas such as packaging and translating, focusing on the concept that anyone can be involved.\r\n\r\nIf the conference organizers would like a keynote from an openSUSE board member, I will be the person who will give the keynote this year and I will use this talk, otherwise i'm happy for to have it as a normal talk.
