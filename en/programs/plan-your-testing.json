Automated testing, especially with the move to GitLab, is more effective than ever. Usability testing has seen a lot of work from Jim Hall and the design team. But what about the planning and organisation around delivering GNOME as a product?\n\nI will discuss the theory and processes around planning testing for a product like GNOME with regular releases, using real life examples from Apertis and how they can be applied to applications and the GNOME desktop. I will discuss the pros and cons of different approaches and how to decide what you should be using. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-gnome/%2Fcoscup18-gnome301-plan-your-testing)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":"Application and platform developers, QA engineers and testers"}},"tracks":{"gnome301":{"group":"gnome","track":"gnome301","communities":["gnome"],"room":"IB301","title":"GNOME.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Kat":{"speaker":"Kat","name":"Kat","intro":"Kat has been a user of Free/Libre software for over a decade and it did not take her long to start contributing.
