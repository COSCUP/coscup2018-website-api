The most popular streaming solutions, Apple Airplay and Chromecast, are closed source implementations which do not integrate reliably with Free software. With Miraclecast, we have an open source solution which could receive a stream from all of your Linux devices. For example, it can be used to stream a video over WiFi to a Raspberry Pi. We are working on solving the sender side issue and a solution that allows casting to a Miracast device easily from the GNOME Desktop. In this talk, we will discuss the current status of the integration and the required changes in the underlying system components.
