Contributing to an Apache project is certainly one of the most direct ways to get in contact with some of the most brilliant software mindsets worldwide to work together on exciting ideas.\n\nHowever, for some beginners to open-source contribution, taking that first step and submitting your first pull request could be quite intimidating.\n\nThis talk aims at introducing how Apache projects operate, how you can engage a project as a new contributor, and key points that lead to a rewarding contribution experience. \n\n----\n* [Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-oss/%2Fcoscup18-oss-the-apache-way)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Beginner / 入門","audience":"Developers interested in open-source contribution (especially ASF projects)"}},"tracks":{"oss":{"group":"oss","track":"oss","communities":["ossoftware"],"room":"IB401","title":"Open Source Software Development & Management\t"}},"speakers":{"戴資力 Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai":{"speaker":"戴資力 Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai","name":"戴資力 Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai","intro":"Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai is an Apache Flink PMC Member and Committer.
