Thus, LibreOffice takes time-based release policy of performing major release with functional additions every six months.\n\nSometimes you may want to use newer LibreOffice (includes daily build or beta/RC testing build) than pre-packaged version shipped with openSUSE Leap 15 (Leap 15 provides latest \"Fresh\" LibreOffice 6.0 at the moment (June), but 6.1 will be released August). Of course, you can use TDF build RPM package instead of openSUSE package, but you can do this quickly with modern packaging systems, like Flatpak, AppImage or Snap. Additionally, you can also use several versions parallelly with them.\n\nIn this talk, I would like to introduce these ways and pros/cons of the packaging systems on openSUSE Leap 15. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-using-latest-libreoffice)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"小笠原 徳彦 Naruhiko Ogasawara":{"speaker":"小笠原 徳彦 Naruhiko Ogasawara","name":"小笠原 徳彦 Naruhiko Ogasawara","intro":"Naruhiko Ogasawara is a member of the LibreOffice Japanese team, and also a member of The Document Foundation; the charitable foundation which is home of LibreOffice.
