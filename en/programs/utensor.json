AI inference today are typically done on high-performance computing units, such as, GPUs and TPUs. MCUs are low-energy and low-cost units. Deploying machine learning models on MCUs is a challenge because of their limited RAM size, flash capacity and clock-speed. uTensor addresses this by converting models directly into importable C++ source code, supporting quantization operators and using resource management schemes. In this talk, we will introduce Tensor, its run-time, code-generator and future work. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-data/%2Fcoscup18-data-utensor)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Embedded Engineers"}},"tracks":{"data":{"group":"data","track":"data","communities":["datascience"],"room":"IB202","title":"Data Science Playground"}},"speakers":{"DBoy Liao":{"speaker":"DBoy Liao","name":"DBoy Liao","intro":"","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"},"Kazami Hsieh":{"speaker":"Kazami Hsieh","name":"Kazami Hsieh","intro":"","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"},"Neil Tan":{"speaker":"Neil Tan","name":"Neil Tan","intro":"Neil Tan is an ARM developer evangelist with a keen interest on IoT and machine learning.
