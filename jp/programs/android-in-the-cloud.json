This year we are going to introduce android-in-the-cloud, an os-level-virtualization technology that enables x86 server to host multiple independent android instances in  containers with resource control feature based on cgroup.  Thru innovative gpu-virtualization every android instance gains gpu’s 3D-acceleration.  In this presentation it’s planned to talk about the project motivation, difficulties encountered , and interesting discoveries.  It’s worthy to mention that we picked android-x86, another open source project initiated by Taiwan’s developer (Chih-Wei Huang), as a stepping stone of android-in-the-cloud.
