It is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture(연변 조선족 자치주/ 延邊朝鮮族自治州) and Changbai Korean Autonomous County(장백 조선족 자치현/ 長白朝鮮族自治縣) of the People's Republic of China[中華人民共和國, Mainland China]. Also It uses in Japan, Uzbekistan, Russia[It reads “Корё мар” in Russian], Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, etc\nAlso, Korean language uses Chinese characters(漢字). It says “Sino-Korean vocabulary” or “한자어(漢字語 / Hanja-eo)” in Korean.  It is similar to  Japanese Kanji[漢字かんじ].\nSo on FLOSS, you have to consider both Chinese and Japanese as well as Korean and vice versa.\n\nI will also show the difference of Korean language in South Korea and North Korea.\n\nI’ll talk about CJK issues in GNOME, LibreOffice, etc, based on Korean Language. \n\n----\n* [Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/X42Lk8TlkTg)\n* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/studioego/coscup-x-gnomeasia-x-opensuse-2018-support-to-korean-language-on-gnome-cjk-issues-of-floss)\n* [Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-gnome/%2Fcoscup18-gnome306-cjk-issues-of-floss)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Beginner / 入門","audience":"GNOME Local Communities & FLOSS CJKV(Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese) Contributors & Translator"}},"tracks":{"gnome306":{"group":"gnome","track":"gnome306","communities":["gnome"],"room":"IB306"}},"speakers":{"DaeHyun Sung":{"speaker":"DaeHyun Sung","name":"DaeHyun Sung (성대현, 成大鉉)","intro":"DaeHyun Sung (성대현, 成大鉉)\nI'm a Korean Software developer in Seoul, Republic of Korea.
