But Tamashii Component, a framework which provides abstract interface let us can craft agent by add gem into our project. For example, Tamashii Component allows users to add IoT component gem directly (eg. tamashii-led) and control led via our Tamashii Component interface. This change the way we use Tamashii, and more flexible compose any devices when we use it.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll explain why we use Tamashii and how Tamashii Component are working to solves the above mentioned problems. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-ruby/%2Fcoscup18-ruby-easier-building-iot-application-use-tamashii)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":"Ruby programmer"}},"tracks":{"ruby":{"group":"ruby","track":"ruby","communities":["ruby"],"room":"IB502"}},"speakers":{"林政隆":{"speaker":"林政隆","name":"林政隆","intro":"Software engineer at 5xruby.tw, Taipei, Taiwan.
