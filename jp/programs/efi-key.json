We can use the mechanism to store a random number in boot services variable as a root key. The root key can be sused to encrypt and authenticate other keys in key retention service in Linux kernel. It can be a new key type.\n\nThis talk introduces the EFI key: \n- EFI key: \n- A new master key type to key retention service. \n- It can be a new option beyond trusted key(TPM) and user key. \n- ERK (EFI Root Key) \n- EFI stub generates a random key and stores in EFI boot services variable. \n- The ERK is secure when secure boot enabled. \n- User must aware and enable secure boot by themself if they want. \n- ERK can be a secret to encrypt a random number for generate a EFI key \n- The EFI key can be used by hibernation encryption/authentication. \n- The EFI key can be a master key to generate a encrypted key for EVM. \n- Rescue mechanism for ERK. \n\n----\n* [Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-efi-key)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201"}},"speakers":{"Joey Lee":{"speaker":"Joey Lee","name":"Joey Lee","intro":"Joey Lee, SUSE Labs Engineer in Taipei office.
