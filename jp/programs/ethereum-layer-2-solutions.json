For example, the average transaction per second of Ethereum is only 25tps. Fortunately, we have some scaling solutions for blockchain that supports smart contract, like Ethereum. These solutions include payment channel, state channel, plasma and BOLT, which is developed by BOLT research team. In this talk, we will introduce these scaling solutions and compare their pros and cons.\n\nref1: [Making Sense of Ethereum’s Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: State Channels, Plasma, and Truebit](https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4)\nref2: [Layer 2](https://github.com/BOLT-Protocol/wiki/blob/master/layer2.pdf) \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-blockchain/%2Fcoscup18-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2-solutions)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"Intermediate Blockchain Engineer"}},"tracks":{"blockchain":{"group":"blockchain","track":"blockchain","communities":["blockchain"],"room":"IB302"}},"speakers":{"呂峻豪":{"speaker":"呂峻豪","name":"呂峻豪","intro":"BOLT Core Developer","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00117-1c0JWVbH0_3Hfv47tIj1TXLO1nfyZ-_oJ.png"},"陳柏翰":{"speaker":"陳柏翰","name":"陳柏翰","intro":"BOLT Core Developer","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"}},"communities":{"blockchain":{"community":"blockchain","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Taipei-Ethereum-Meetup","image":"/assets/taipei_ethereum_meetup_logo_small-1GuqSgiH8P8TH_5R_LIBrbia8X7ufCZba.png"}}}
