Both initiatives are backed by The Document Foundation (TDF), a non-profit organization in Germany. LibreOffice is a free and open source cross-platform office application suite, it is available for a number of operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Additionally, as a truly globalized application, it is available in many different languages of the world. It is used daily by tens of millions of people. I will also be talking about the improvements in LibreOffice Version 6.1. Furthermore, I will be demonstrating a number of interesting usages of LibreOffice in creating documents such as product catalogs, e-books, and PDF forms. Participants will gain a good understanding of what LibreOffice is about and how they can contribute to its community. Participants will appreciate the diversity of documents that can be created with LibreOffice through the live demonstrations and how easy it is to learn.
