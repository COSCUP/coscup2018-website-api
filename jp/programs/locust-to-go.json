This feature admit us to implement bots, with any programming language support ZeroMQ.\nWe build our game services using Go language, so we reuse some Go code to implement bots. We run our game services on dockers managed by Google Kubernetes, we try to DDoS our game services using dockers managed by Google Kubernetes, too. Finally we tweaked a reliable game service which is able to handle huge amount of users.\nThis talk will share what is Locust, how to implement Locust slave, and how to do load test using Locust and Google Kubenetes. \n\n----\n* [Slides](https://hackmd.io/p/r13TRUdrX#/)\n* [Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-sdn/%2Fcoscup18-sdn-locust-to-go)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"Go programmers and site reliability engineers who want to know how to tweak performance of cloud service."}},"tracks":{"sdn":{"group":"sdn","track":"sdn","communities":["sdn"],"room":"IB401"}},"speakers":{"郭學聰 (Heush-Tsung Kuo)":{"speaker":"郭學聰 (Heush-Tsung Kuo)","name":"郭學聰 (Heush-Tsung Kuo)","intro":"* programmer from Rayark, a game company in Taiwan\n* backend engineer\n* usually develop something related to my work in Python, Ruby, Golang, C#\n* built almost entire VOEZ game server by myself only\n* support Sdorica backend development","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00146-10ITxJ1_fJEoe3WUCSMYmTpdTLm17RtXk.png"}},"communities":{"sdn":{"community":"sdn","link":"","image":null}}}
