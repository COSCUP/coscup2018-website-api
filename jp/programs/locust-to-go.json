This feature admit us to implement bots, with any programming language support ZeroMQ.\nWe build our game services using Go language, so we reuse some Go code to implement bots. We run our game services on dockers managed by Google Kubernetes, we try to DDoS our game services using dockers managed by Google Kubernetes, too. Finally we tweaked a reliable game service which is able to handle huge amount of users.\nThis talk will share what is Locust, how to implement Locust slave, and how to do load test using Locust and Google Kubenetes.
