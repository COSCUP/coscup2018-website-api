In this talk I'll review important open source NN frameworks, namely TensorFlow Lite + Android NN and Caffe2. Then I'll walk the audience  through important source code of TenorFlow Lite and Caffe 2. For TensorFlow Lite, the interpreter and sample command line label_image will be covered. The talk will be a heavily modified one of [1] and [2], a much more code-oriented one.\n\n[1] https://www.slideshare.net/kstan2/introduction-to-tensorflow-lite\n[2] https://www.slideshare.net/kstan2/caffe2-on-android ","addition":"* Language: 臺語 / Taiwanese\n* Audience: Android/iOS developers who want to put \"AI\" to edge devices.\n* Difficulty: Skilled / 中階"}},"tracks":{"source":{"group":"source","track":"source","communities":["coscup"],"room":"IB503"}},"speakers":{"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan":{"speaker":"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan","name":"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan","intro":"Koan-Sin Tan is a veteran open source user who learned to use Unix on VAX-11/780 running 4.3BSD. He was interested in making NN models working cell phone recently. He wrote the label_image for TFLite, the first non-Google C/C++ command line example for TensorFlow Lite.","link":"","avatar":"/assets/Photo on 12-23-11 at 5.07 PM - Koan-Sin Tan-1oqJ0V9aBihl8-64Kiij4LzxsfZLV2j_O.jpg"}},"communities":{}}
