The goal is to implement a production quality switch platform that supports standard management interfaces and opens the forwarding functions to programmatic extension and control.\n\nOpen vSwitch is well suited to function as a virtual switch in VM environments. In addition to exposing standard control and visibility interfaces to the virtual networking layer, it was designed to support distribution across multiple physical servers. Open vSwitch supports multiple Linux-based virtualization technologies including Xen/XenServer, KVM, and VirtualBox.\n\nIn this talk, I would like to give an overview about the Open vSwitch project and including the following topic: \n- What is Open vSwitch and why we need Open vSwitch? \n- Open vSwitch support features \n- Open vSwitch architecture \n- Current status of Open vSwitch \n- How to install Open vSwitch in openSUSE \n- Introduction Open vSwitch daemons and tools \n\n----\n* [Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-open-vswitch)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Beginner / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201"}},"speakers":{"DavidChang (suse)":{"speaker":"DavidChang (suse)","name":"David Chang","intro":"David Chang is a software engineer of SUSE Labs who mainly working on\nethernet drivers update of SUSE Linux.
