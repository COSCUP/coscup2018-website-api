This is because the use of proprietary products on the market is quite dominant. This often makes non mainstream applications such as Inkscape, Gimp, Krita, Synfig, etc. which incidentally is open source application underestimated. In fact, these applications are highly qualified and powerful to meet the needs of graphic design both general and specific. \r\nIn this session, I will describe my experiences during using these applications to create designs in openSUSE. In addition, I will also tell you about the design community in Indonesia that has been fully using open source applications as the main application to create graphic design work. This community is named Gimpscape ID. \r\nFinally, I will describe what I have done to contribute to an open source project through this graphic design. Hopefully after this session, users of open source design applications are more confident and willing to contribute as well.
