To support extensions, the Python API (Application Programmers Interface) defines a set of functions, macros, and variables that provide access to most aspects of the Python run-time system. The Python API is incorporated in a C source file by including the header\"Python.h\". The compilation of an extension module depends on its intended use as well as on your system setup; details are given in the talk. I hope to share it with other people in our community. Thanks!
