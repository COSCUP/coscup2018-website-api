To support extensions, the Python API (Application Programmers Interface) defines a set of functions, macros, and variables that provide access to most aspects of the Python run-time system. The Python API is incorporated in a C source file by including the header\"Python.h\". The compilation of an extension module depends on its intended use as well as on your system setup; details are given in the talk. I hope to share it with other people in our community. Thanks! \n\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-python-package-with-c)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304"}},"speakers":{"赵强":{"speaker":"赵强","name":"赵强","intro":"我在 openSUSE 社群中做了许多工作，主要参与了中日韩和东亚各语言的国际化工作。主要内容包括输入法，字体，翻译等。","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00095-1RWfH7C3gUJFG8goBv0qmJRCGlrF31HkC.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
