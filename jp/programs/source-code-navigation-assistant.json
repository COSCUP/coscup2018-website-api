The speech speed of the screen reader is usually incredibly fast, and it reads almost everything on the screen.  Also, the generated speech is not so friendly for the users.\n\nHowever, it's important for people to quickly get the meaningful summary of the current source code navigation, even for people with average eye-sight.\n\nThis talk introduces you the design of the navigation assistant, and the technical implementation details of the tool.\n\nThe assistant is implemented in Go, and its language parser is used to generate a short comprehensive summary, and the text will be converted to voice speech to improve your source code navigation experience.
