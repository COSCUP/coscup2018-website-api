Contributing to an Apache project is certainly one of the most direct ways to get in contact with some of the most brilliant software mindsets worldwide to work together on exciting ideas.\n\nHowever, for some beginners to open-source contribution, taking that first step and submitting your first pull request could be quite intimidating.\n\nThis talk aims at introducing how Apache projects operate, how you can engage a project as a new contributor, and key points that lead to a rewarding contribution experience.
