I would take this oppertunity to open Photo album of openSUSE.Asia Summit and share with you all about our stories. Might you are in our stories, and might you will be in our stories. \n\nI will also introduce our process of call for host, call for logo design, call for paper and call for volunteer, so that people can better know how do they get involve in. This is no possible to make openSUSE.Asia summit happen by just one people, so with you, we are openSUSE.Asia summit. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-we-are-opensuse-asia-summit)","addition":"","language":"English / Chinese","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201"}},"speakers":{"Sunny":{"speaker":"Sunny","name":"Sunny","intro":"I'm Sunny, and I come from China.
