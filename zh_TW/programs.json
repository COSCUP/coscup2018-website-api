Strictly speaking, the role of input method framework is bridging desktop applications and input method engines, which translate typed keys into complex characters. During this two decades, several input method frameworks including Kinput2, SCIM, UIM, Gcin, Fcitx, and IBus have been developed.\n\nThe situation surrounding text input method is changing. Firstly, new approaches such as software keyboard for touch screen and speech to text input are available on platforms other than Linux desktop.\n\nAnother change is the integration of input method into desktop application platforms. For example, IBus is now a part of GNOME desktop environment; Not only GNOME, Qt also include IBus support. Furthermore, Flatpack also uses a subset of IBus D-Bus interface for applications in Flatpack sandbox to communicate with an input method running on its host desktop.\n\nSome people might think IBus is the defacto standard input method framework. However, quite many people prefer Fcitx or else due to the design issues of IBus. The latter people might think they are losing their freedom to select input method framework.\n\nNow the speaker thinks that it is time to discuss the variety of input method frameworks is really necessary for the future Linux desktop environment. An input method framework itself does not provide much experience for users because its primary role is usually invisible to users. Thereby, how about bringing the war of input method framework and using our effort to improve input method engine, implementing the new approaches mentioned above, and supporting newer application platforms like Wayland?\n\nIn this talk, we would like to discuss what is necessary for the future input method framework by reviewing the design issues of IBus. The topics will be as the followings:\n\n- Thin and high-level protocol with libraries avoiding code duplication \n- The separation of responsibility between IBus daemon and plugins \n- Importance of opened community\n\nNote that the speaker is neither a developer of IBus nor GNOME. The attendees from GNOME community are welcome to improve this discussion.

Based on ONNX, ONNC is an efficient way to connect all current AI chips, especially DLA ASICs, with ONNX.\n\nOpen Neural Network Exchange Format (ONNX) is a standard for representing deep learning models that enables models to be transferred between frameworks. We introduce ONNC that supports ONNX format and mainstream AI frameworks such as Caffe and Tensorflow. ONNC’s dominant advantage to current AI frameworks is that it provides direct support to DLA ASIC chips by ability to describe variants of performance cost models of hardware and by general optimization passes. DLA ASIC vendors can reuse these optimization passes by describing its special performance cost model in ONNC. ONNX and ONNC together help DLA ASIC vendors support various AI frameworks within a short time, improves DLA’s performance and shortens developing schedule. \n\nONNX aims to guarantee `interoperatability` for all tools, and ONNC further guarantees `executability` for all devices.

However, it's sometimes a bit boring for some \npeople who want to know/manage the whole of the things such as physical network, \nstorage, machines, etc. And also, an experience of building a tiny \ncloud with physical machines could be a very good opportunity to \nunderstand computer technologies. Moreover, it's fun for such people \nlike me.\n\nI had built a my own tiny private cloud with openSUSE and OpenStack on \nmy own physical machines. And I'm now using it for some of purposes \nsuch as evaluating new Linux distributions, containers, Kubernetes, \netc. I had allocated the budget around only 50k JPY (500USD) for \nbuilding it. It's quite a cheap to build a *cloud* system, actually. \nHowever, it can be done with open source software and some tricks.\n\nIn this talk, attendees will get to know about the *tiny private \ncloud* how to build, issues/challenges, benefit and the potential \ncapabilities of openSUSE.

","intro":"openSUSE project, a community program sponsored by SUSE in order to promoting the use of Linux everywhere. This program aims to provides free, easy access to the world's most usable Linux distribution (openSUSE).\n\nopenSUSE has been a community-driven project that, despite sponsorship from SUSE, is relatively independent. About two years ago, openSUSE decided to move the base of openSUSE Leap to SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), which SLE is a tightly controlled enterprise ship that runs on mission critical systems. The fact is that moving to SLE source code would solve many problems for both SLE and openSUSE via creating a symbiotic relationship in which they can pull the content from each other.\n\nAt the end, openSUSE project restructured its distributions and created two distributions: Leap and Tumbleweed.\n\nTumbleweed, the fully-tested rolling release, became upstream for SLE; whereas Leap is based on SLE and inching itself towards full compatibility with SLE.

How come OSS can be developed so rapidely and spread so widely in this short time. Its licensing model, which is different from the past common software licensing model, plays an important role. This kind of licensing model allows users to copy, modify and distribute software directly, without asking the owner of a software for permission additionally. OSS can hence easily be modified and implemented in different industries. Speaker will accordingly introduce the characteristics of OSS licensing model and the related actual articles in OSS licenses. Besides, the commonly used OSS licenses and the differences between these licenses will also be talked about. This talk serves as the introduction of this track and will be held in Chinese so that the majority of audience can better understand the content of the talk and the following sessions.  / 開源軟體從崛起、受到矚目，再到目前許多產業已經不能沒有它的狀況，僅短短發展二、三十年，為什麼開源軟體的發展可以這麼快速？其中一個重要的原因就是它擁有不同於以往的授權模式。開源授權模式允許使用者可以直接重製、修改與散布軟體，而不需要再額外徵詢軟體所有權人的同意，開源軟體因此很容易被改進以及被運用到不同的地方。本場次因此將會介紹開源授權的特性，白話地說明其在授權條款上是如何被實際規定出來，同時也會簡介常見的開源授權條款，以及這些條款間的重大差異。本場次是這個議程軌的基礎導論，用以協助會眾了解接下來的議程內容，所以本場次會以中文進行。 ","addition":"* Language: 漢語 / Mandarin Chinese\n* Audience: 任何想要了解開源授權，或者想要以符合授權條款規定來利用開源軟體的人。 / Anyone who wants to understand OSS licensing or to use OSS in compliance with license terms.\n* Difficulty: Begineer / 入門"},"newton-project":{"talk":"newton-project","track":"blockchain","speakers":["Xu Jizhe 徐继哲"],"begin":"2018-08-12T09:50:00+08:00","end":"2018-08-12T10:10:00+08:00","title":"牛顿项目：作为协议经济的基础设施 Newton project: The infrastructure for a protocol-based economy ","intro":"1. why newton 作为协议经济的基础设施，牛顿构建了 “超级交换协议”，包括数字身份和信用、供应链、交易、支付等方面。底层通过 NewChain、NewNet、NewIoT、原子哈希技术等支撑超级交换协议，上层开发者可以基于超级交换协议开发支付、商城、保险等 DAPP 应用。As an infrastructure of protocol-based economy, Newton build \"hyper exchange protocol\", which includes digital identitiy and credit, supply chain, transaction, and payment,etc..

About User privacy 数据来自于用户，所以数据理应是属于我们每一个人的。不过，目前很多互联网平台通过售卖用户数据来赚钱，用户隐私被严重侵害。Newton 区块链技术让这一切成为历史，属于用户的数据产生的收益将还于用户。数据是 21 世纪的石油，用户有权获得数据产生的收益。  The data comes from the user, so the data should belong to each of us.

Newton's blockchain technology makes it all history, and the revenue generated by the user's data will return to the user.   Data is oil in the 21st century, and users have the right to gain the data.    3. Future of organization development 公司这种组织结构诞生于几百年前的工业革命时期，其主要目的是为了盈利，同时让少部分称为“股东” 的人受益。同时，为了生存和发展、公司不断占领市场，寻求超级利润，实现垄断，才有可能生存和发展。这个时候的公司和外部世界是存在明显的壁垒，公司内部人员难以和公司外部建立和谐的协作关系，而且，传统公司的利润主要来源于对消费者的盘剥，这就会逐渐演变成双方之间零和博弈的对抗性。这样非此消彼长的循环游戏不利于创造和谐共赢的经济发展环境。而传统的组织架构里，这是难以周全的一个问题。区块链技术的产生则有可能为这一问题带来解决方案。未来应该由一个非盈利基金会所管理的社群经济体来取代现在的由盈利公司所管理的封闭平台。This organizational structure of the company was born during the Industrial Revolution hundreds of years ago. Its main purpose was to make profits while benefiting a small number of people who were called \"shareholders.\" At the same time, in order to survive and develop, the company continues to occupy the market, seeks super-profits, and realizes monopolies, it is possible to survive and develop. At this time, there are obvious barriers between the company and the outside world. It is difficult for the company's internal staff to establish a harmonious and cooperative relationship with the outside of the company. Moreover, the profit of the traditional company mainly comes from the exploitation of consumers, which will gradually evolve into a relationship of Zero-sum game and confrontation between the two parties. This non-reversing cycle game is not conducive to creating a harmonious and win-win environment for economic development. In the traditional organizational structure, this is a difficult problem. The emergence of blockchain technology may bring solutions to this problem. The future should be replaced by a community economy managed by a non-profit foundation to replace the current closed platform managed by a profitable company.   4. How for geek  人类社会的科技活动大致可以分为两个阶段，第一阶段是探索真理，比如发展基础理论，第二个阶段是科技应用，是科技真正创造价值、服务于人类的阶段。区块链技术从诞生至今，也是符合这样的规律，2018 年以前所有的区块链项目都有一个共同的特点，本身都是在技术探索阶段，为了发展技术而使用技术。比如 Linux 1.0 之前，他就是 Torvalds 和一群极客的玩具。这个时候它没有任何的用途，他也不能 Power 任何的网站。大家参与是出于兴趣。很多年以前的比特币也是类似这样的一个状态。然而当技术发展到一定程度，其成熟度达到一个拐点，足以和人类的生活融合，这个技术就必须得服务于社会，应用于行业，为我们的生活创造价值，这个技术才有意义。The scientific and technological activities of human society can be roughly divided into two stages. The first stage is to explore the truth, such as the development of basic theory. The second stage is the application of science and technology. It is the stage when science and technology truly create value and serve humanity. Since the birth of blockchain technology, it is also in line with such laws. All blockchain projects before 2018 have a common feature. They are themselves at the stage of technology exploration and use technology to develop technology. For example, before Linux 1.0, it was Torvalds and a group of geek toys. It doesn't have any use at this time, and he can't power any website. Everyone's participation is out of interest.Many years ago Bitcoin was also a similar state. However, when the technology develops to a certain degree, its maturity reaches a turning point and is enough to integrate with human life. This technology must be applied to the society, applied to the industry, and create value for our lives. This technology makes sense.

Furthermore, the newly merged AF_XDP patch set allows the user to do the zero-copy access to the packets, and this could bring more performance improvement to the userspace program.

ICOs raised large amounts of ostensible investment-money, only to categorically declare the funds as being “revenue,” in an attempt to absolve themselves of any material obligations to deliver a functioning and portable system, much less an efficient system.\n\n     \n\n    On the other hand, we feel that a large portion of commerce taking place within China’s still-growing economy is waiting for a “magnitudinous leap forward” whereby the full advantages of the blockchain in terms of data-integrity and the creation of liquidity may be applied to the material and quotidian needs of individuals, groups, shops, factories, warehouses, and other productive and honest activities. In very truth, these activities form the backbone of the civilized state, and are what computing technologies were (originally, as it was premised) expected to serve.\n\n     \n\n    Pandachain is therefore pleased to offer itself as a benefactive and not malefactive, mellontological and not shortsighted solution representing financial and technological might in service of knowledge. Pandachain is not just another ICO. Specifically, it was not founded upon the axiom of composing a realistic-sounding premise to improve a particular sector of economic activity (such as cloud-computing or data-storage) with minimal reference to the underlying productive realities of the supply-chain. Our project is not one which seeks to forcefully connect, through contrived and largely imaginary strictures, that already-working segment of the economy with a narrow range of blockchain-themed pretensions.\n\n     \n\n    Most such projects are shallow precisely because they are designed to nurture ICOs by propounding the blockchain as a replacement for generic problems which were already solved decades ago by the invention of databases. On the contrary, Pandachain, which is built upon hundreds of collective man-years of experience in customary engineering and commerce, and which possesses solid intellectual property to be exercised upon its domain (patents, artwork, novels, licensing rights to films, …) is unique in not seeking, even less loudly proclaiming, that it will “enmesh the economy in blockchain.”\n\n     \n\n    The Panda is a symbol of honesty and integrity. He is not a graduate of the Charlatan University. Using the blockchain and its mechanisms for building trust, achieving consensus, promoting liquidity, and lowering the barriers of ordinary citizens to commerce and investment, Pandachain seeks, instead, to “enmesh the blockchain in Panda.”\n\n     \n\n    Thus, we are pleased to offer a real-time, responsibly governed, semi-decentralized legion of Panda blockchain-nodes, run upon ordinary users' cellphones and home-computers, as well as in corporations, which are able, owing to the fiduciary power of smart contracts, to incrementally improve trade relations, fruitful exchanges of merchandise, and also domestic and intercontinental understanding.\n\n     \n\n    By allowing large numbers of people to freely invest in Pandachain, and then committing their coins to virtual joint-stock corporations, virtual agents, drones, and such, they will be able to participate in the “economy of circulations,” leading to a large-scale increase in liquidity, and ultimately, to the advent of the “gift economy.” We believe in the power of responsible regulation and compliance with society's norms. To that effect, our blockchain will be optimized for auditability, for transparency, and for the novel concept of\"modular\"regulatory compliance based upon the efforts of\"facilitation committees.\"The Panda is, in effect, not only patriotic toward his country which feeds him bamboo, but also the guardian of\"Blockchain with Panda Characteristics.\"\n\n\n    Panda Community’s  principle is to reward contributions,  to promote innovations and to ensure sustainability.\n\n\n    For Developers:\n\n\n    Panda foundation always  supports freeware and open source society；\n\n    Panda’s free blockchain development course already have 500 graduates, and will remain free in the future. Our goal is to help 30,000+ dedicated talents becoming senior blockchain developers. The market needs at least 80,000 of them now, and the course will keep going;\n\n    API and SDK will be free for the community, and a technical support team will be there to help;\n\n    Contributors of Panda-funded projects will be rewarded by cash or token, depending on the projects’ funding method;\n\n    All Panda-funded projects will be open to the community, be our guest and be proud to code on a beach;\n\n    All developers could publish their ware on Panda Dappstore. Indie developers will never be charged;\n\n    Copyrights to be protected by smart contracts and royalties would be settled to right-holders automatically.\n\n\n    For Users:\n\n\n    We believe in Robinhood-ism, we charge Fortune-500s and governments of developed countries to support the society;\n\n    Wares will remain free for charities, students and vulnerable groups;\n\n    Individual users contributed in promotion, feedback, community operation and so on would be rewarded by token;\n\n    Please send us your ideas.\n\n\n    The world needs real heroes, those dare to steal fire from above and to fight the power with gigantic drills.

Current ODK (Open Data Kit) with OMK (Open Map Kit) is popular and leveraged quite often, however, it needs some additional IT efforts for deployment before starting the field survey.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the all-in-one service: geoBingAn, which allows users to perform the field surveys (to interact with OSM data/tag) just as easy as if they were using Google Forms on OSM basemap from mobile. Moreover, the surveys can be performed by clicking on OSM building object for updating the tags by answering form, planned the Area of Interest with polygons drawing on basemap, deliver the assignments and accomplished message with app notification, and all the collected survey data can be exported in GeoJSON or KML file just with a few clicks from web UI.\n\nWe believe this OSM tool will lower the barrier of using OSM data for field surveyors, can even encourage the volunteer who doesn't have the knowledge of OSM tagging to contribute for OSM with proper form designed.

The youths are now becoming aware of the advantages of open source. There are several small opensource communities in Nepal. As an effort to help people familiarize with opensource and to fit the computing behaviour of Nepalese, they have also developed a Linux distro ie. chitwanix.

To support extensions, the Python API (Application Programmers Interface) defines a set of functions, macros, and variables that provide access to most aspects of the Python run-time system. The Python API is incorporated in a C source file by including the header\"Python.h\". The compilation of an extension module depends on its intended use as well as on your system setup; details are given in the talk. I hope to share it with other people in our community. Thanks!

In a country like India, where people living below the poverty lines is more than 22% of the countries 1.3 billion population, money is a scarce resource.\n\nA great portion of this money could be saved by using open source alternatives to proprietary softwares that do the same work at almost no extra cost, and be used elsewhere for better causes.\n\nGovernment of India has introduced various goals and schemes to develop and bring up the computer literacy to everyone in the country, digital India initiative is one such. OpenForge is an open platform that is aimed at organizing policies aimed at open-source by the Govt. of India.\n\nOn 8th November 2016, the government of India announced the demonetisation of all 500 and 1000 rupee bank notes. The whole nation had to suffer in this duration of the cash shortage. The people to suffer most were the ones who had little to no access and knowledge to digital technologies, elderly, low income and less educated were affected the worst. There were even reported deaths due to this.\n\nOne of the major barriers in introducing technology to these people is the language. India has more than 880 languages and dialects spoken across the nation. English is still poorly understood, and this is a huge challenge. It is not possible for a single organisation to support most of those languages in the translations. This is where opensource community and contributors come in, without help from the localization communities, significant amount of translations for the utility apps for at least the official languages wouldn't be possible.\n\nUnlike other Linux distros, what people like about openSUSE is its stability, a huge repository of softwares and the ease of installing them. If a person can install an app from appstore, one can definitely install softwares on openSUSE. This is one of the major reason why so many of friends and I love openSUSE.\n\nThis is what makes it ideal for the FOSS initiatives for humanity that we have currently started to undertake. \nMoreover, unlike Windows and Mac, developing softwares in Linux is much lighter on the system. Making it is ideal for people with less hardware resources to bring their ideas-to-life.\n\nopenSUSE is one-of-a-kind tool that has the potential to lead our journey to make and achieve something great for the people. Over the past few years openSUSE user group in India hasn't seen much of the growth. This maybe because of the fame of Ubuntu in the country. Much of the people still don't know that there isn't one but many distributions of Linux to choose from. Free and open source softwares are all about the freedom of choice, and without making people know about the choices they have, freedom can't fully be achieved.\n\nVarious initiatives have been taken to by colleges and communities in India, including ours.
