The specification could define the number of VMs deployed, each VM’s resources (such as memory, CPU, disk, and networking parameters), the type of applications in a VM (such as load balancer, web server or database server), VM’s communications mechanisms (such as socket or queues), anomaly event triggers by VM (such as rebooting an application and up/down interfaces according to timer), etc. With such a powerful application synthesizer, the testers possess the capability to reliably test Application Performance Management in a controlled and scalable cloud environment. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-oss/%2Fcoscup18-oss-application-synthesizer)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"DevOps engineer"}},"tracks":{"oss":{"group":"oss","track":"oss","communities":["ossoftware"],"room":"IB401","title":"Open Source Software Development & Management\t"}},"speakers":{"Ming Jiang":{"speaker":"Ming Jiang","name":"Ming Jiang","intro":"Dr. Ming Jiang received his BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University and PhD degree in electrical engineering and computer science from University of Illinois at Chicago.
