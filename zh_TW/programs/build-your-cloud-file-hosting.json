It is functionally similar to Dropbox, although Nextcloud is free and open-source, allowing anyone to install and operate it on a private server. \nIn contrast to proprietary services like Dropbox, the open architecture allows adding functionality to the server in form of applications and enables users to have full control of their data. \nThe original ownCloud developer Frank Karlitschek forked ownCloud and created Nextcloud, which continues to be actively developed by Karlitschek and other members of the original ownCloud team.\n\nin the case of this time, I use openSUSE Leap 15.0 to build nextcloud on it, and I will explain briefly how I can build it and installing nextcloud steps above openSUSE Leap 15.0, which turns out to build nextcloud on your own computer is not too difficult, easy even for beginners though.\n\nso we can build their own cloud file hosting, and that too is free to obtain and is an open source \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-build-your-cloud-file-hosting)","addition":"","language":"English and Indonesia","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Mohammad Rifki Affandi Z":{"speaker":"Mohammad Rifki Affandi Z","name":"Mohammad Rifki Affandi Z","intro":"I am a college student in Sebelas Maret University and openSUSE user since 2016","link":"","avatar":"/assets/opensuseasiasummit-1xOJTAdtC7Gf3cjZP3JQfoarTYZnKBalv.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE 亞洲高峰會是 openSUSE 社群 (即: 貢獻者跟使用者) 很重要的活動之一，那些平常都在線上交流的人，現在可以一起面對面，與來自世界各地的高手進行交流，社群成員將會分享他們最新的知識、經驗，並學習關於 openSUSE FLOSS 的技術。\n\n這次在台北的活動是 openSUSE 亞洲高峰會的第五次，繼 2014 年首次的亞洲高峰會是在北京之後，過去的亞洲高峰有來自中國、台灣、印度、印度尼西亞、日本、南韓等國的參加。","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
