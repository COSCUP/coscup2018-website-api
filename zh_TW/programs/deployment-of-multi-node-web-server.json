What is Ansible? Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine which can remove drudgery from your work life, and will also dramatically improve the scalability, consistency, and reliability of your IT environment. \nWe use ansible to deploy web servers, database servers with galera clusters, and session storage servers with master-slave mode. With the use of this tool can reduce the time required in deployment servers, and unidentical server in a group can be avoided ","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Didiet Agus Pambudiono":{"speaker":"Didiet Agus Pambudiono","name":"Didiet Agus Pambudiono","intro":"openSUSE user, member of openSUSE Indonesia, and Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE 亞洲高峰會是 openSUSE 社群 (即: 貢獻者跟使用者) 很重要的活動之一，那些平常都在線上交流的人，現在可以一起面對面，與來自世界各地的高手進行交流，社群成員將會分享他們最新的知識、經驗，並學習關於 openSUSE FLOSS 的技術。\n\n這次在台北的活動是 openSUSE 亞洲高峰會的第五次，繼 2014 年首次的亞洲高峰會是在北京之後，過去的亞洲高峰有來自中國、台灣、印度、印度尼西亞、日本、南韓等國的參加。","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
