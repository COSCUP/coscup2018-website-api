","intro":"The digital literacy in the developing countries like Nepal is expanding very slowly. The main reason behind this is the lack of infrastructure. For establishing a digital world, the first and foremost requirement is the availability of resources. We used to suffer from electricity blackout for 16 hours per day one year ago. In such a situation, we cannot expect to digitize the area. Now, the situation is not the same. Slowly, the internet facility is expanding in major cities. \nStudents in college are provided with the knowledge of the open source nowadays. The youths are now becoming aware of the advantages of open source. There are several small opensource communities in Nepal. As an effort to help people familiarize with opensource and to fit the computing behaviour of Nepalese, they have also developed a Linux distro ie. chitwanix. OpenStreet map was widely used for the rescue during the massive earthquake in Nepal. Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal and the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) are other few initiatives in large scale to digitize Nepal. \nThus, it is our responsibility to spread the knowledge of open source in developing countries like Nepal and it takes time.
