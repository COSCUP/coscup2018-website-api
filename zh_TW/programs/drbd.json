I wish openSUSE will support LINSTOR. and I think basic philosophy is same.\n\nHA cluster used by DRBD is more usable. DRBD can use with pacemaker and Corosync, with kubernetes. and more. this talk introduces them. \npacemaker and Corosync can manage clusters. pacemaker and Corosync change active node when detecting a failure. \nDRBD support kubernetes by Kubernetes Flex Volume plugin.\n\nI remark easy step to setup HA cluster with DRBD. so attendee can learn how to setup HA cluster with easy way and HA cluster background philosophy. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-drbd)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Syuta Hashimoto":{"speaker":"Syuta Hashimoto","name":"Syuta Hashimoto","intro":"openSUSE-ja member.
