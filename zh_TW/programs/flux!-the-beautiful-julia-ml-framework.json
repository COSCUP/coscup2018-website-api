It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. Flux makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable.\" We will show a beautiful approach of building a deep learning model using Flux and how powerful a dynamic framework could be.
