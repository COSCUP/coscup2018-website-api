It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. Flux makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable.\" We will show a beautiful approach of building a deep learning model using Flux and how powerful a dynamic framework could be. \n\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-julia/%2Fcoscup18-julia-flux!-the-beautiful-julia-ml-framework)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"deep learning enthusiasts"}},"tracks":{"julia":{"group":"julia","track":"julia","communities":["julia"],"room":"IB308","title":"Julia Language"}},"speakers":{"鄭景文":{"speaker":"鄭景文","name":"鄭景文","intro":"A regular student in Taiwan","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00055-1z4S6CTntN1LiuNjPvEyyaz52TqJkuMNY.png"}},"communities":{"julia":{"community":"julia","title":"Julia Language","intro":"一切關於 Julia 語言的大小事，本次可能穿插 workshop 及 talk。","link":"","image":null}}}
