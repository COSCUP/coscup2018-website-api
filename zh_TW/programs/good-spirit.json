So we have to maintain the good spirit to keep us alive and fun :-)\n\nIn the earlier year we always do a monthly or bi-monthly offline meeting, at that time the internet connection still not massive like it is right now. It was important to meet in person to maintain the cohesiveness of the community. While it was good, but that offline meeting only effective in certain area mainly in Jakarta metropolitan area. Right now, the communication means using internet connection, like website, facebook and telegram are more effective. \nOff course we still do offline meeting/class but not as many as the earlier year.\n\nAs of May 2018, our facebook group have around 4200 member and around 1100 member are active user. Telegram group member are around 370 as of May 2018. Our web site https://opensuse.id is accessed around 51 hits per day.\n\nThis is about openSUSE community progress in our country and examining it in the last 3 years, we're on the right track. \nI would love to share the experience promoting openSUSE and also want to hear other community experience in other Asian countries.
