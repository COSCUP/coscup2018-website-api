In this talk I will give a brief introduction of HiDPI and share the status of HiDPI support on openSUSE Leap15 and summarize how to tweak the scaling factors for YaST Installer, Grub2(on both Legacy and UEFI mode), GDM, GNOME Session, SDDM, KDE Plasma, other apps (on both X and Wayland), some known issues and the support of fractional scaling from a Desktop user's perspective.\n\nHopefully this talk will help some openSUSE users to get their life with a HiDPI screen more pleasant.\n\nAbout the Speaker: \nMy name is Chingkai Chu, I am a software engineer from Beijing SLE Desktop Dev&QA Team. This talk is based on a HiDPI testing for SLED15 and openSUSE Leap15 in my team. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-hidpi-support-on-opensuse-leap15)","addition":"","language":"漢語 / Mandarin Chinese","difficulty":"Begineer / 入門","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Chingkai Chu / 朱庆凯":{"speaker":"Chingkai Chu / 朱庆凯","name":"Chingkai Chu / 朱庆凯","intro":"My name is Chingkai Chu, I am a software engineer from Beijing SLE Desktop Dev&QA Team. \n","link":"","avatar":"/assets/opensuseasiasummit-1xOJTAdtC7Gf3cjZP3JQfoarTYZnKBalv.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE 亞洲高峰會是 openSUSE 社群 (即: 貢獻者跟使用者) 很重要的活動之一，那些平常都在線上交流的人，現在可以一起面對面，與來自世界各地的高手進行交流，社群成員將會分享他們最新的知識、經驗，並學習關於 openSUSE FLOSS 的技術。\n\n這次在台北的活動是 openSUSE 亞洲高峰會的第五次，繼 2014 年首次的亞洲高峰會是在北京之後，過去的亞洲高峰有來自中國、台灣、印度、印度尼西亞、日本、南韓等國的參加。","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
