His area of expertise is in full-stack web development, and he understands how to work with business partners to develop advanced cloud-based systems that support applications with a world-class user experience. Edward holds degrees in Mathematics and Physics from Rowan University and is fully self-taught in computer science. He is also a language enthusiast and polyglot, and he speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese, Dutch, and French in addition to conversational bits and pieces in a half-dozen other languages from around the world. He spent almost a decade living and working in Taiwan. Edward Greve has a wide range of experience from different regions and brings with him a varied skill set to the IOTA Foundation, and while his primary role will be full stack front-end development, he plays a key role in supporting the IOTA Foundation’s efforts on the ground in Asia to establish IOTA as a standard in the region for IoT and beyond. His polyglot abilities is also a very useful asset for obvious reasons.","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00038-1LbTgL5Wo2VZt_-CfSyu1MAwGJ1SBjGNy.png"}},"communities":{"coscup":{"community":"coscup","title":"COSCUP","intro":"COSCUP 是由台灣開放原始碼社群聯合推動的年度研討會，起源於 2006 年，是台灣自由軟體運動 (FOSSM) 重要的推動者之一。活動包括有講座、攤位、社團同樂會等，除了邀請國際的重量級演講者之外，台灣本土的自由軟體推動者也經常在此發表演說，會議的發起人、工作人員與講者都是志願參與的志工。\n\nCOSCUP 的宗旨在於提供一個聯結開放原始碼開發者、使用者與推廣者的平台。希望藉由每年一度的研討會，來推動自由及開放原始碼軟體 (FLOSS)。","link":"https://coscup.org","image":null}}}
