In this talk I'll review important open source NN frameworks, namely TensorFlow Lite + Android NN and Caffe2. Then I'll walk the audience  through important source code of TenorFlow Lite and Caffe 2. For TensorFlow Lite, the interpreter and sample command line label_image will be covered. The talk will be a heavily modified one of [1] and [2], a much more code-oriented one.\n\n[1] https://www.slideshare.net/kstan2/introduction-to-tensorflow-lite\n[2] https://www.slideshare.net/kstan2/caffe2-on-android \n\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-source/%2Fcoscup18-source-neural-network-frameworks)","addition":"","language":"臺語 / Taiwanese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":"Android/iOS developers who want to put \"AI\" to edge devices."}},"tracks":{"source":{"group":"source","track":"source","communities":["coscup"],"room":"IB503","title":"帶您讀源碼"}},"speakers":{"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan":{"speaker":"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan","name":"\"freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan","intro":"Koan-Sin Tan is a veteran open source user who learned to use Unix on VAX-11/780 running 4.3BSD. He was interested in making NN models working cell phone recently. He wrote the label_image for TFLite, the first non-Google C/C++ command line example for TensorFlow Lite.","link":"","avatar":"/assets/s00029-1dcQVE31mlXP_2BlcGe2hIO3HhFWGMfdI.png"}},"communities":{"coscup":{"community":"coscup","title":"COSCUP","intro":"COSCUP 是由台灣開放原始碼社群聯合推動的年度研討會，起源於 2006 年，是台灣自由軟體運動 (FOSSM) 重要的推動者之一。活動包括有講座、攤位、社團同樂會等，除了邀請國際的重量級演講者之外，台灣本土的自由軟體推動者也經常在此發表演說，會議的發起人、工作人員與講者都是志願參與的志工。\n\nCOSCUP 的宗旨在於提供一個聯結開放原始碼開發者、使用者與推廣者的平台。希望藉由每年一度的研討會，來推動自由及開放原始碼軟體 (FLOSS)。","link":"https://coscup.org","image":null}}}
