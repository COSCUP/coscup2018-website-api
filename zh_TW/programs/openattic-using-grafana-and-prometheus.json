Within openATTIC, it contains lots of different projects to provide all the functions including salt, Grafana and Prometheus.\n\nThis will not be a ceph or openATTIC focus talk, even we use it as the example of showing how everything work together. Instead we will look into openATTIC to see how each project work with each other. Mainly focus on Grafana and Prometheus, they are not only very useful for ceph and openATTIC but also equally powerful for monitoring your clusters, vm or cloud / container status.\n\nBoth Grafana and Prometheus are very easy to extend, which allow user or administrator to build the dashboard which fit their own need. Even the presentation example will be base on ceph / storage. Participants can use the same idea to monitor any system status they wanted after understand how they work. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse201-openattic-using-grafana-and-prometheus)","addition":"","language":"English / Chinese","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse201":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse201","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB201","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Alex Lau (AvengerMoJo)":{"speaker":"Alex Lau (AvengerMoJo)","name":"Alex Lau (AvengerMoJo)","intro":"AvengerMoJo is Alex’s online nickname.
