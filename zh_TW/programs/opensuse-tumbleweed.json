This is because the use of proprietary products on the market is quite dominant. This often makes non mainstream applications such as Inkscape, Gimp, Krita, Synfig, etc. which incidentally is open source application underestimated. In fact, these applications are highly qualified and powerful to meet the needs of graphic design both general and specific. \r\nIn this session, I will describe my experiences during using these applications to create designs in openSUSE. In addition, I will also tell you about the design community in Indonesia that has been fully using open source applications as the main application to create graphic design work. This community is named Gimpscape ID. \r\nFinally, I will describe what I have done to contribute to an open source project through this graphic design. Hopefully after this session, users of open source design applications are more confident and willing to contribute as well. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-opensuse-tumbleweed)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Ahmad Romadhon Hidayatullah a.k.a Rania Amina":{"speaker":"Ahmad Romadhon Hidayatullah a.k.a Rania Amina","name":"Ahmad Romadhon Hidayatullah a.k.a Rania Amina","intro":"","link":"","avatar":"/assets/gnomeasiasummit-1g4cy0zFJhEc19vQDd4OC1hu_DArg7zQd.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE 亞洲高峰會是 openSUSE 社群 (即: 貢獻者跟使用者) 很重要的活動之一，那些平常都在線上交流的人，現在可以一起面對面，與來自世界各地的高手進行交流，社群成員將會分享他們最新的知識、經驗，並學習關於 openSUSE FLOSS 的技術。\n\n這次在台北的活動是 openSUSE 亞洲高峰會的第五次，繼 2014 年首次的亞洲高峰會是在北京之後，過去的亞洲高峰有來自中國、台灣、印度、印度尼西亞、日本、南韓等國的參加。","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
