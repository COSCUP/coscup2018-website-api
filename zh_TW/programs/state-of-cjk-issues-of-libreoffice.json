LibreOffice 's CJK and problems unique to the Japanese environment are various such as vertical writing, external characters, phonetic, currency and date notation. \nSometimes CJK regression bugs occur in the LibreOffice project. It is important to strengthen user's feedback loop approach. However, I would like to find regression bugs by testing. \nIn last year's talk, I organized mainly examples of concrete CJK bugs. In this year's talk, As the first, I will analyze the bug database and introduce the trend. Secondly, I will organize major CJK bug cases. Thirdly, I will discuss how to test CJK functionality to find bugs before release. \n\n----\n[Collaborative notes on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/coscup18-opensuse/%2Fcoscup18-opensuse304-state-of-cjk-issues-of-libreoffice)","addition":"","language":"English","difficulty":"Skilled / 中階","audience":""}},"tracks":{"opensuse304":{"group":"opensuse","track":"opensuse304","communities":["opensuse"],"room":"IB304","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit"}},"speakers":{"Shinji Enoki\n榎 真治":{"speaker":"Shinji Enoki\n榎 真治","name":"Shinji Enoki\n榎 真治","intro":"Shinji Enoki is a member of LibreOffice Japanese Team.\nHe focuses on planning of events and sometimes on QA activities e.g. bug triage.\nHis other community activities is a chairperson of Japan UNIX Society,\na member of Kyoto OpenData Community and a staff of KANSAI OPEN SOURCE.\nHe is freelance, and he is developing LibreOffice support business\nwith iCRAFT Corp.","link":"","avatar":"/assets/coscup-1A2gYj9iSEiiUXRUuW2quhoIP7LFgJvmh.png"}},"communities":{"opensuse":{"community":"opensuse","title":"openSUSE.Asia Summit","intro":"openSUSE 亞洲高峰會是 openSUSE 社群 (即: 貢獻者跟使用者) 很重要的活動之一，那些平常都在線上交流的人，現在可以一起面對面，與來自世界各地的高手進行交流，社群成員將會分享他們最新的知識、經驗，並學習關於 openSUSE FLOSS 的技術。\n\n這次在台北的活動是 openSUSE 亞洲高峰會的第五次，繼 2014 年首次的亞洲高峰會是在北京之後，過去的亞洲高峰有來自中國、台灣、印度、印度尼西亞、日本、南韓等國的參加。","link":"https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia18","image":"/assets/2018_openSUSE_Asia_Summit_logo-1zMh7cP5ZGgsk2CWkTnx-Oxm9z-z5QYEe.png"}}}
